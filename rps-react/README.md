## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Of course, the main point of this project was learning a framework. I decided to go with React and I think it allowed me to grasp the basics of it, as I successfully worked with components, props, state and effect hooks.

Learning some npm basics was useful as well. Managed to overwrite my repo in the process, but got everything back fortunately.

### Continued development

Using React was fun, I look forward to learning it more in depth in the forthcoming projects.

### Useful resources

- [React JS Crash Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&) - I really enjoy Brad's way of teaching. It helped me to understand all the basics.
- [React Hooks by Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6P86uwfdR0&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h) - Now, after Brad's tutorial I needed some more knowledge on Hooks and Kyle from Web Dev Simplified did deliver.
